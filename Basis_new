in sql I have 4 tables I want to merge into one larger table called: adjustments_all
The tables are adjustments_four, adjustments_one, adjustments_three, and adjustments_two.
They all have the same headers and I just want to merge them.
the column names and their type are as follows:
school, text
school_year, text
indicator_id, integer
school_id, text
family_id, text
family_name, text
family_first_name, text
family_last_name, text
family_full_name, text
month_adjusted, date (month and year)
adjustment_date, date
applied_on, text
student_first_name, text
student_last_name, text
student_full_name, text
fees_name, text
original_amount, float
adjustment_amount, float
new_amount, float
reason_for_adjustment, text
adjusted_by, text

SOLUTION:
CREATE TABLE adjustments_all (
    school TEXT,
    school_year TEXT,
    indicator_id INTEGER,
    school_id TEXT,
    family_id TEXT,
    family_name TEXT,
    family_first_name TEXT,
    family_last_name TEXT,
    family_full_name TEXT,
    month_adjusted DATE,
    adjustment_date DATE,
    applied_on TEXT,
    student_first_name TEXT,
    student_last_name TEXT,
    student_full_name TEXT,
    fees_name TEXT,
    original_amount FLOAT,
    adjustment_amount FLOAT,
    new_amount FLOAT,
    reason_for_adjustment TEXT,
    adjusted_by TEXT
);

INSERT INTO adjustments_all
    SELECT * FROM adjustments_one
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM adjustments_two
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM adjustments_three
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM adjustments_four;
