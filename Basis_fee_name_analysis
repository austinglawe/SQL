So I wanted to see what adjustment fees to the basis project were relevant and this gives a little better view of it
I wanted find the number of times the fee name had been used, then the total from it, then the maximum amount of each, then the minimum amount of each, then the average amount of each


SELECT  COUNT(*) AS num_of,
        SUM(original_amount) AS tot_original_amt,
        SUM(adjustment_amount) AS tot_adj_amt,
        SUM(new_amount) AS total_new_amt,
		MAX(original_amount) AS max_original_amt,
		MAX(adjustment_amount) AS max_adj_amt,
		MAX(new_amount) AS max_new_amt,
		MIN(original_amount) AS min_new_amt,
		MIN(adjustment_amount) AS min_adj_amt,
		MIN(new_amount) AS min_new_amt,
		AVG(original_amount) AS avg_original_amt,
		AVG(adjustment_amount) AS avg_adj_amt,
		AVG(new_amount) AS avg_new_amt,
        fees_name
FROM adjustments_all
GROUP BY fees_name

This determines if you take out all the results taht had no original fee amount suggesting....
SELECT *
FROM(
SELECT  COUNT(*) AS num_of,
        SUM(original_amount) AS tot_original_amt,
        SUM(adjustment_amount) AS tot_adj_amt,
        SUM(new_amount) AS total_new_amt,
		MAX(original_amount) AS max_original_amt,
		MAX(adjustment_amount) AS max_adj_amt,
		MAX(new_amount) AS max_new_amt,
		MIN(original_amount) AS min_new_amt,
		MIN(adjustment_amount) AS min_adj_amt,
		MIN(new_amount) AS min_new_amt,
		AVG(original_amount) AS avg_original_amt,
		AVG(adjustment_amount) AS avg_adj_amt,
		AVG(new_amount) AS avg_new_amt,
        fees_name
FROM adjustments_all
GROUP BY fees_name)
WHERE tot_original_amt = 0
