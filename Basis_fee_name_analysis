So I wanted to see what adjustment fees to the basis project were relevant and this gives a little better view of it
I wanted find the number of times the fee name had been used. then the total from it, then the 

SELECT  COUNT(*),
        SUM(original_amount),
        SUM(adjustment_amount),
        SUM(new_amount),
		MAX(original_amount),
		MAX(adjustment_amount),
		MAX(new_amount),
		MIN(original_amount),
		MIN(adjustment_amount),
		MIN(new_amount),
        fees_name
FROM adjustments_all
GROUP BY fees_name
