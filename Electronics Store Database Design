# For this project, I downloaded a digital media store database file called chinook.
# Then I inserted the database into SQLite.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# I then explored the data to get familiar with it.
# Then I was given questions to find the answers to.

# First I determined what tables were in the data set and all the columns they contained using the dropdown arrows in SQLite.

# I then got familiar with the data by exploring the tables



# For each table, I used a simple SQL code as follows:
SELECT *
FROM (table name)
# Instead of "(table name)", I used each table, these tables are:
  media_types, genres, playlists, playlist_track, tracks, artists, albums, invoices, invoice_items, customers, emplooyees




# I needed to determined all customers who are not within the US. And I wanted to know their full name, customer ID, and the country they are in.
SELECT  FirstName, 
        LastName,

SELECT *
