 SELECT *

 OR points > 1000 AND state = 'VA'
 -- AND is always evaluated first, AND has a higher precedence
 
 
 
  SELECT *
 FROM customers
 WHERE NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000)
 -- the NOT operator is the reverse of everything so this would be intrepreted as
 -- (birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000)
 -- as you can see, the one written directly above is easier to comprehend though
